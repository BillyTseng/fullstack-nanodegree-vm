This project presented a Python script uses Flask to build a web catalog website. This website provided functions to create, read, update, and delete to query a SQLite database, and it has integrated with Google sign-in to distinguish the different users with different permission to edit/delete items. Also, this project implemented JSON API endpoints to help users to obtain the structured data of full catalog or an arbitrary item in the catalog.
